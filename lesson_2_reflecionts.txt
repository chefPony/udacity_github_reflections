What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates an hidden folder .git with metadata about the folder hisotry, initially 
nothing is committed since it's not assumed you would want to commit all the files
in the folder and you may want to leave a custom comment. All of this is needed in
orther to start using git version control features in the current folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is in between the directory and the repository, files from the working directory must pass through the staging are before being committed and
become tracked in the repository. It enables flexibility to choose which files I want to track in the repository and which want I don't want to. In addition I could
decide to start tracking different files during different commits, the staging area
also enables to do that.
